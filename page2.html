                    <h1>How we really use the web</h1>
                    <p>There is a big difference between, how people view websites and how we think people view websites. It’s common for you to believe, that users viewing your website are going to look at very part of the web page. And when you are creating the webpage you might make some parts of your webpage have a lot of content.
                    
                    <p>But what most people are used to doing is just glace through the website while going through the first most interesting thing they can find.</p>
                    
                    <p>The reason why you might mistakenly create a website with a lot of content “most of the content condensed in one area” is that you, or anybody else for that matter might assume that we are designing webpages for people who use websites the way we do – or that the large majority of our users are rational and attentive. But that is not usually the case.When trying to design any web page you have to put into consideration the three facts of using a webpage, and these are;</p>
                    
                    <h3>Most people don’t read web pages they scan through them.</h3>
                    <p>Most people don’t spend most of their time reading though all the content on the web page they just scan through it. Looking for key words and phrases that might catch their eye. This only applies if the webpage is not a news website or sports website, for such websites users usually read them but might revert to scanning periodically.</p>
                    
                    <p>The major reasons why people scan include.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Most people are usually on a mission:</b> People accessing web pages are usually on a mission and act like sharks “they have to keep moving or they will die”. This simply means that they don’t have time to read everything.</li>
                         
                        <li><b>Some people realize that they don’t have to read everything:</b> This is as a result of looking for items on webpages that much their interests or a task that needs attention while the reset is irrelevant.</li>
                        <li><b>Scanning is what people are good at it:</b> This skill comes as a result of knowing how to read. Web users have been scanning through content on pages for a while now and expect that all webpages be implemented in kind of the some why, like magazines, Facebook or Tumblr.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>People don’t make optimal choices they usually satisfice. </h3>
                    <p>It’s common to believe that when people are accessing webpages they consider all the available options and chose the best one.</p>
                    <p>The reality is that most people just choose the first option that’s the most convenient for them.</p>
                    <p>Even if they believe that it might not lead to what they want, they still click it any ways. This was a behavior notices by Economist Herbert Simon and he says it “a cross between satisfying and sufficing”.</p>
                    <p>In a book written by Klein titled Sources of Power how people make decisions which states that mostly people pick the first plan they have make a metal test for any possible problem and if there is no foreseeable problem they have a plan of action.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to note that most web users don’t look for the best choice because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>They are usually in a hurry:</b> mainly because optimizing is hard and satisficing is much easier and takes less time.</li>
                        <li><b>They are no consequences for guessing wrong:</b> the most major consequence for a wrong choice is 2 or more clicks at the back button.</li>
                        <li><b>Thinking about the possible options might not improve your chances: </b>this is usually experienced by people using poorly designed website and doesn’t improve your chances if you put effort to think about the best choice.</li>
                        <li><b>The joy of guessing:</b> most people like the element of chance and plus if you guess right it’s faster. This also gives users the opportunity to explore newly and undiscovered areas of the world wide web, for they could land into something interesting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Most people don’t figure how things work but prefer to muddle through. </h3>
                    <p>After conducting numerous usability testing on either websites, software or household appliances, if become clear that most people try to use products before they understand how they work and sometimes with complete wrong ideas on the product functions.<br/><br/>
                    This is because, people usually don’t take the time to read any of the instructions but would rather make up stories on how they think the websites, software or household appliances works or how it should be used.<br/><br/>
                    This approach is how users usually get things done, where lots of people use websites, software or household appliances in ways that were never intended.<br/><br/> 
                    For example, many people that use the web browser barely know how it works to them you just type stuff and something happens. And some people think google is the internet.</p>
                    <p>Why do people muddle through websites, software or household appliances?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It’s important that they understand how it work as long as it’s useable and produces some meaningful result.</li>
                        <li>If users find something that works they usually stick to it. Even though it doesn’t have perfect functionality users will tend to stick to it not matter what.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So, if muddling is what people prefer, does it matter if webpages are designed so user get it?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes, because there is a good chance they will find what they are looking for </li>
                        <li>This could improve their understanding on what your site offers and the full range of services your website covers.</li>
                        <li>You can easily guide them to areas of the site you think they find interesting if you design webpages they understand.</li>
                        <li>This improves how they feel about themselves, in that they feel much smarter and in control of when using your website. This leaves a lasting impression and cause them to come back</li>
