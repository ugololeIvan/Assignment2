<h1><strong>What do you test and when do you test it.</strong></h1>
<p>The testing process is usually made by the developers and they get to choose what will be tested each month.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to start testing as early as possible for it is much easier to find errors in the website and the cost of fixing the site is much lower when you find problems easily.</p>>
<p>Below are reasons you might resist to test your webpage early</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not much of the site has been completed: </strong>this is as a result of the site not yet working so most people prefer not to show sites that have not functionality.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s unfinished and a bit sketchy: </strong></li>
<li><strong>Why show something that you might change: </strong>it&rsquo;s important to show you website early on because users might find problem you might have missed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735773"></a><strong>Testing your site.</strong></h2>
<p>The testing process gives you the ability to see which parts of you site don&rsquo;t meet the users&rsquo; expectations. And which of those parts you might want to fix a head of time. It will give you the opportunity to understand how the web users use you site.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735774"></a><strong>Testing other sites.</strong></h2>
<p>It a good idea to test other peoples&rsquo; sites before you start building your own. These sites could include webpages designed by you competitors or sites that contain information that you want to implement.</p>
<p>By testing other people&rsquo;s site, you could learn a lot in terms of how webpages are built and how other users prefer certain web pages to be built.</p>
<p>For example, this site is inspired by brilliant.com.</p>
<p>You can test other peoples&rsquo; site by giving users task you want them to perform on those sites and compare them to your own site. This comparison is made best on how people access the site and what they do when they access the site.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to focus on what worked well and which solutions could work when fixing any problems that occur once the test it done rather than focusing only on the problem that happened during this kind of testing. Because you can&rsquo;t really change anything for it&rsquo;s not your site.</p>
<p>Note: testing other peoples&rsquo; site is most enjoyed by the marketing and management sector of your company because they are always curious about what other people are doing and how the competitors site works.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735775"></a><strong>Testing the sketch on the napkin</strong></h2>
<p>This is simply having a rough sketch about how the site will look and function. You could sketch the appearance of the home page for example, how the home page will respond when used.</p>
<p>These tests involve using concept drawings like mono to create a visual representation of the sites functionality. And they are usually referred to as &ldquo;sketch on napkin&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Napkin test should not be considered as full test because each test is like five minutes long and involves using people like your friends or neighbors to conduct the test.</p>
<p>This can be done by.</p>
<ul>
<li>Approach any one friendly</li>
<li>Ask them to take a look at your website sketch</li>
<li>Then simply ask them what they think it is.</li>
<li>Simply listen to their opinion about the functionality of the site and if they are correct in determining what the site does and what it means.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will allow you to understand you site from the users&rsquo; perspective and hopefully give you early ideas on how you could improve your website before you start the coding process.</p>
<p>The large majority of what you thought was a good idea might be too complicated for users to understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735776"></a><strong>Testing using wireframes</strong></h2>
<p>Immediately after sketching it&rsquo;s important to start working on your wire frames. A wireframe is a schematic diagram of a page and is used to show the different types of content that will go on the web page. These could include</p>
<ul>
<li>Headings</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>Menus and search</li>
</ul>
<p>Below Is an example of a wireframe actually used for this web page</p>
<img style="width:100%; height:100%;" src="images/imgDoc/grid%20example.png">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These tests don&rsquo;t take long because they are people who can do them and are done in sessions which include testing peoples&rsquo; site and your current site.</p>
<p>You usually learn how to categorize or name the sections in your website and if the content these sections have is what people expect to find in them. If a website has been arranged in a specific order, does it match peoples&rsquo; expectation of how your site should be?</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735777"></a><strong>Testing page designs</strong>.</h2>
<p>Most web pages have some unique pages, these webpages include the home or the series of templates like the section front pages, article pages and product pages.</p>
<p>These unique pages are repeated throughout the site while containing different content &ndash; so testing page design involves creating visual treatment of different types of pages. With the main focus being of the visual design.</p>
<p>If you need to test the home page you could start by leading them to the home page design and ask them to create a narrative of the home or any other page that is current undergoing testing.</p>
<p>The aim of this kind of testing is to see if the visual design has caused any kind of usability issues.</p>
<p>The question you ask you self during the testing process is &ldquo;can people figure out how the design is supposed to work?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735778"></a><strong>Testing while working with prototypes</strong></h2>
<p>This involves working with actual prototypes of your webpage. The testing could also involve finished projects.</p>
