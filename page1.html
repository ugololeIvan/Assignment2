                    <h1>Don't make the user think</h1>
                    <p>This chapter introduces Krug’s first law of usability, which is “nothing important should ever be more than 2 clicks away”. This also implies that all websites that are well designed must be self-evident and obvious – the website must be easy to understand the moment the user has a chance to see with out needing to over think about its functionality.</p>
                    
                    <p>Creating a website that doesn’t make its users over think can be archived by using</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A list of categories to left if needed by the website that the user can be clickable. </li>
                        <li>Large enough images that the user can click, to select any of the various items displayed on the site.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>What make users think</h3>
                    <p>Most command things on web pages that make us think include </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Names of buttons.</li>
                        <li>Clickable or non-clickable areas.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><b>Names of buttons:</b> - using non-common names to mark potential activity i.e. instead of “login” one could use “enter account”. This approach causes users to think and it not advisable.</p> 
                    <p><b>Clickable or non-clickable areas:</b> - not specifying that a certain section of your website i.e. a button or tab is clickable could also cause a user to be confused and hence think.</p>
                    
                    <p>A list of what users shouldn't think about</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Where am I?</li>
                        <li>Where should I begin?</li>
                        <li>Where did they put ……?</li>
                        <li>What are the most important things on the website?</li>
                        <li>Why was it given that name?</li>
                        <li>Is that a form of advertisement or a part of the website?</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Your aim is to make each page fill self-explanatory, such that any user that opens up your website can understand without having to ask so many self-directed questions about the functionality of your website. But in some situations, you might not be able to make aspects of your website obvious. Especially if you are creating something original or complete new. But with tiny tweaks in color or layout it’s possible to add self-evident features to your site.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>   
                    <p>For completive reasons, it’s important to ensure that website make users feel comfortable as they use them. If not, most users will opt for the competitor’s website and you will lose important customers. In most cases some users have no choice but to stick with poorly implemented non-obvious website because;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It happens to be a company’s app like a bank or a site that has a rare item they are looking for.</li>
                        <li>It could be that they have tried other competitors, and yours is the lest frustrating.</li>
                        <li>Or maybe they are tired of looking for a better alternative and would rather stick with what does look well than bather themselves with looking for an alternative </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Even though some of these people have no options but to use the site, it’s important to make it feel self-evident because it makes things seem better and easier to use and prevents users from wasting energy and time “trying to solve puzzles”</p>
