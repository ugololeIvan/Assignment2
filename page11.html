                    <h1><a name="_Toc508735765"></a><strong>A morning a month that&rsquo;s all we ask</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;Given the fact that, the leading reason as to why people don&rsquo;t do usability test is, they believe &ldquo;it has to be a big production&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s complicated and will take a lot of time to complete.</p>
<p>This is not true because they are ways to do it easily, like doing one month of testing witch 3 or more users once a month. You could do 3 tests in the morning and finalize them over launch. And this will be the entire monthly usability testing.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735766"></a><strong>Things to note:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a name="_Toc508735767"></a> <strong>Morning</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>will mean that the test is limited to just half a day and using only 3 users will simplify the recruiting process so that more people will come to watch. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="_Toc508735768"></a> <strong>Month:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good interval for doing usability test because it&rsquo;s affordable and it can be to identify enough problems. Using monthly tests makes it a routine which eliminates having to decide when to do the tests.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735769"></a><strong>Differences between Do It Yourself and the Big Honkin&rsquo;s Test</strong></h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc508735770"></a><strong>Do It Yourself</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Spent:</strong> during the morning hours and once every month. And completed by the afternoon.</li>
<li><strong>When do you test:</strong> this is done continuously throughout the development process.</li>
<li><strong>Number of testing rounds: </strong>Testing is done once every month.</li>
<li><strong>People doing testing: </strong>Three individuals are called upon to do the testing.</li>
<li><strong>Location of testing:</strong> The testing is done on the site</li>
<li><strong>Who watches:</strong> normal people that are invited can watch</li>
<li><strong>Reporting:</strong> contains a 2 pages email that talks about the decision made during the briefing.</li>
<li><strong>Problem identification:</strong> This is done by the entire development team.</li>
<li><strong>Cost: </strong>5000$ to 15000$</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc508735771"></a><strong>The Big Honkin&rsquo;s Test</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Spent:</strong> 1 to 2 days of testing followed by a week of briefing.</li>
<li><strong>When do you test:</strong> this is usually done near to the end of site completion.</li>
<li><strong>Number of testing rounds: </strong>Is done once per project because time is expensive</li>
<li><strong>People doing testing: </strong>5 to 8 or more as needed by the project.</li>
<li><strong>Location of testing:</strong> The testing is done off the site</li>
<li><strong>Who watches:</strong> normal people that are invited can watch, many in number.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting: </strong>done by an individual who takes a week to prepare the briefing.</li>
<li><strong>Problem identification:</strong> This is done by the person running the test who compares the final result and recommends any changes.</li>
<li><strong>Cost: </strong>a few hundred dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It might not be possible to complete the Do it your self-test in the morning of any month. The first attempt could take you between 2 to 3 days making the preparations.</li>
<li>You could also perform the test more than once per month, for once per month serves as the bare minimum.</li>
<li>The do it yourself is a best fit with agile which is based on rapidly producing working portions and getting them to the end user. Note that it&rsquo;s a bit challenging because you will be working with fast moving programmers who assume they are writing code that works well.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have to schedule any test in the morning because it might be difficult for some people to attend, for they might be working. It okay, to schedule the tests later in the evening. It&rsquo; important to keep the test at least half of the day.</li>
<li>Remember the point of this testing &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; is not to improve anything but rather to identify the problems that can be fixed. For this reason, it&rsquo;s important to note that once a month might not provide you with enough statistical data about the functionality of you test.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of testing might vary from region to region here are the usually items whose costs you will need to keep track of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microphone</li>
<li>Speakers</li>
<li>Screen recording</li>
<li>Screen sharing</li>
<li>Snacks/lunch for observers</li>
<li>Incentives</li>
