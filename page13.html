                    <h1><strong>Recruit loosely and grade on a curve.</strong></h1>
<p>The aim is to find people to recruit so they could participate in the testing of your web site. You&rsquo;ll need to schedule appoints and get the chosen ones to attend the testing event.</p>
<p>The finds you are trying to make will answer the following questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of people should you testing with?</li>
<li>What is the number of people required during testing?</li>
<li>Where will you find the people, you are going to use for testing?</li>
<li>How do you make up for using their time?</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc508735780"></a><strong>What kind of people should you test with</strong></h3>
<p>Who you actually chose to test your site might not seem to be the easiest question to answer because of the fact below</p>
<ul>
<li>Test representative will likely encounter the same problems as the people that are most likely to use your website.</li>
<li>People that are not part of you targeted audience might have problems that your current users might not.</li>
<li>People in your current audience poses domain knowledge, that others might not have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Domain knowledge is the kind of knowledge needed in order to be able to use a tool or some form of equipment.</p>
<p>So, when doing this kind of usability testing you could start by loosely recruiting from a much more diverse audience and as time passes by you could only focus on your current audience.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc508735781"></a><strong>What is the number of people required during testing?</strong></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to test as many users as you can, for the more users you test the less likely you will encounter new problems.</p>
<p>But with do it your self-testing you are not interested in how any problems you can find, but rather how many problems you can fix.</p>
<p>Hence settling with 3 users for each round of testing could be the only thing you need because;</p>
<ul>
<li>They might encounter most of the major problems you site has</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easier to find 3 participants than a large number of participants</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to do more rounds of testing than to have a single round while having a lot of users</li>
<li>Testing a lot of users comes with a huge number of overhead which could cause diminishing returns. This could money spent on food and time spent checking all mail generated.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc508735782"></a><strong>Where will you find the people, you are going to use for testing?</strong></h3>
<p>You could consider to hire a recruiter, that will help you find people to carry out the test with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But this approach is costly an alternative is using any friends or family member you have to help with the testing process.</p>
<p>And if you are working in a company consider using some of you work colleges because they intend to make a good impression and have good domain knowledge, they will be happy to participate in the testing process.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc508735783"></a><strong>How do you make up for using their time?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>You can create some form of competition where people win prizes in the end</li>
<li>You could pay some of the organizers that where involved in setting up the arrangements for the testing of you web application.</li>
<li>Offer free food to those that come on time.</li>
<li>Provide gift cards to anyone who participates well.</li>
