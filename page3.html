                    <h3>Designing for scanning not for reading.</h3>
                    <p>Considering the fact that people scan your page and not read every part of it. It’s important that you design your site such that they see as much as you need them to. The is done by;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taking advantage of conventions</li>
                        <li>Create effective visual hierarches</li>
                        <li>Break pages up into clearly defined areas</li>
                        <li>Make clickable areas obvious</li>
                        <li>Ensure to have as few distractions as possible.</li>
                        <li>Format you content to allow you users to scan through it easily.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Conventions</h3>
                    <p>It’s easy to create a webpage that is easy to understand if you use pre-existing conventions, for example people expect the logo of a webpage to be on the left-hand side. And the primary navigation to be across the top or button left side.<br/><br/>
                    Users using a site that sells item are used to the metaphor of shopping cart to mean items that are placed for purchase. They are also used to a familiar pattern when actually making a purchase of a given item using either their credit card or debit card.<br/><br/>
                    Many webpages have a standardized appearance which include icon that tells you, if it’s a link to a video or search bar or any kind of social networking site.<br/><br/>
                    Conventions started out as an idea that worked well which was incorporated by many websites to the point of it being a standard of how people navigate the site.<br/><br/>
                    It’s common for web developer to stray away from using conventions and try to reinvent the wheel usually because rewards like job promotion are rarely based on sticking with conventions. But conventions help improve usability.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc508663358"></a><strong>Clarity trumps consistency</strong></h2>
<p>Given the choice between making something clear or making it consistent always choose in favor of clarity by;</p>
<ol>
<li><a name="_Toc508663359"></a> <strong>Creating effective visual hierarchies.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure that all the visual cues accurately portray the relationships between the things on the page, these include items that are the most important, items that are similar, and what items are part of other items.</p>
<p>This allows each page to have a clear hierarchy. Pages that have clear hierarchy have 3 important features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance is backed by prominence: </strong>the most important words are usually bold and have a large text size. Sometimes they could have a much larger white space and are usually nearer to the top.</li>
<li><strong>Related items have visually recognizable appearance: </strong>they are visually similar to each other in terms of styles and font used to represent them. You could also group items that are related under the same header.</li>
<li><strong>Items on a web page are nested to illustrate which item is part of what: </strong>for example, a section name called computer book will have different types of computer books placed under it reflecting that each book is part of the generalized section called computer book.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: make sure as you are designing the webpage, to use a visual hierarchy where a heading doesn&rsquo;t span over things that are not part of it. Like having a heading such as Computer books span over sub-heading such as books, music or movies.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><a name="_Toc508663360"></a> <strong>Breaking up the webpage into clearly defined areas</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to divide the webpage into clearly defined areas because it allows users to quickly identify which parts of the webpage they are mostly interested in and just ignore the areas of the webpage they don&rsquo;t find interesting.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><a name="_Toc508663361"></a> <strong>It&rsquo;s important that the clickable areas of the web page are visible</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is important because some users are looking for what to click next, so making it clear what can be clicked makes it easy for users to decide which part of the webpage to click on.</p>
<p>This is done by having a hand symbol when hovering over what can be clicked. You could also use different colors for areas that are clickable.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><a name="_Toc508663362"></a> <strong>Use lest amount of visual noise</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The importance of this, is due to the fact that people have a low tolerance for visual noise such as distractions could potentially find these pages annoying. The types of visual noise include.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shouting:</strong> This is usually seen on webpages that want user&rsquo;s attention and is achieved with overwhelming invitations to buy or even distracting colors. Some webpages could even go as far as using automated colors and animations which pop-up</li>
<li><strong>Disorganizations:</strong> Placement of items on a webpage without following any conventional patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Clutter:</strong> Some home pages that have too much information that the user may not need. This could make it difficult for user to see the content that brought them to the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><a name="_Toc508663363"></a> <strong>Text used on the pages should allow users to easily scan them</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The text should include headings where it is appropriate and lists if necessary. The heading is used to inform the user about the meaning of the text he or she is seeing.</p>
<p>Make sure that there is a visual distinction between each heading. The heading should never float and should be as close as possible to the content they head.</p>
<p>Keep the paragraphs as short as possible and only containing the content that is needed. Long paragraphs make it difficult for users to read.</p>
<p>Use bulleted lists for items that can be bulleted, the should be bulleted for example list of items separated by commas or semicolon and you&rsquo;ll find likely candidates. You should include small amounts of space between the items in the list to allow users to see them easily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to highlight key items because when users scan the page they usually look at key words or phrases. But it&rsquo;s important not to have too many highlighted items</p>
