<p>It is important to carry out usability testing after you have made your product, in this case your webpage. Usability testing is defined as;</p>
<p>The process of watching people try to use something that you have created in an attempt to understand how to make it easier for people to user or to prove that it easy for them to use.</p>
<p>The most common way of testing is simply just watching how people use your website. And is a much different approach compared to previously used approaches like surveys or interviews.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735756"></a><strong>They are 2 types of most important usability test these include</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a name="_Toc508735757"></a> <strong>Quantitative:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This involves proving if the current version of the site is better than the previous one or if the current website is better than the competitors.</p>
<ol>
<li>It also involves measuring the success rate of the website.</li>
<li>In terms of if people finish the tasks that they are given.</li>
<li>This types also requires you to carefully collect large amounts of data about how the webpage is used by different kinds of people.</li>
<li>It also involves minimizing interactions with the participants to prevent interfering with the overall result.</li>
<li>In extreme cases the kind of testing is known as voice of God testing where by users set by in a room and are given instructions on what to do by a facilitator who also observers how they follow instruction.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="_Toc508735758"></a> <strong>Qualitative:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is the opposite of quantitative testing and its purpose is not to prove anything but to get insights that allow you to improve the quality of the website that you are building.</p>
<ol>
<li>As a result, qualitative approach is considered to be informal and unscientific &ndash; this means you can test fewer users as long as you get the information you need.</li>
<li>Qualitative approach is considered dynamic in that you can change the testing if the user can not complete it. This should not be done in quantitative because it would affect the result.</li>
<li>This testing approach does not have any data gathering involved.</li>
<li>This could be a one on one approach between the facilitator and participant, where the facilitator gives task to the participant and asks him / her to think aloud while trying to solve the task.</li>
<li>Once the test is complete notes are compared in hope to find solutions to problems that have occurred in the webpage.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases qualitative testing involves creating a task for users to do for example, creating or booking an appointment. This could be done by a volunteer while the site creator will seat at the side writing notes and making observations.</p>
<p>The aim of this kind of approach is to show users that it works and it&rsquo;s not as hard as it seems.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735759"></a><strong>Reason for qualitative approach and why it works</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a name="_Toc508735760"></a> <strong>All sites have issues that need fixing:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>most site including this site that being built has usability problems. Some sites have less usability problems than other because they have through a lot of testing.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="_Toc508735761"></a> <strong>Most serious problems are easy to find:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>some could include how the user creates an account or even deleting previous account, paying for stuff online. These are areas where problems could exist and require fixing.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="_Toc508735762"></a> <strong>Watching users makes you a better designer:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most web designer don&rsquo;t watch how users are using their website and end up designing the website for their abstract idea of a user. This idea of a user is based on designer of the most part. Watching people user your website proves your understanding on how people use your web page and help you design websites better.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc508735763"></a><strong>Reasons why people might not do testing</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Time might not be something any of the web designer have on their hands so they chose to skip usability testing all to-gather.</li>
<li>There is also a tendency for people designer not to show their work before it&rsquo;s finished. As Steve Krug would put it, &ldquo;why bother showing it to people and wasting their time&rdquo;.</li>
